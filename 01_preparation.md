# Python for linguists


## 1. Preparation (Python, PyCharm)

**1.1.** Without searching the web, what do you think Python is?

**1.2.** Without searching the web, how do you think programming works, roughly?

**1.3.** What do you hope to learn or gain from this course? (Simply 'a diploma' is a totally valid answer, albeit somewhat uninspiring.) Write your answer down, and periodically look at it to keep you on track.

**1.4.** This course is for 5 EC. How many hours of study does this represent? Divided over around 15 weeks, how many hours a week does this represent?

**1.5.** Given the foregoing, and your personal goals, how many hours a week do you _want_ to spend on this course?

**1.6.** Go into your calendar and schedule regular, recurring blocks of time in which you will work on this course. Give the recurring calendar event a name that reflects your goal (e.g., `improve my programming` can be better than `Python homework`).

**Something to keep in mind:** You can write Python programs in any plain text editor (or even with pen on paper!), but many tools exist to make programming easier, safer and more enjoyable. Most programmers work in an **IDE** ('Integrated Development Environment'), which typically contains a text editor with features such as _syntax highlighting_, _style checking_, coding help and auto-completion, as well as tools for running and debugging your programs, version management, even code sharing.

**1.7.** For this course please install the **PyCharm IDE** on your computer: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ . The 'community edition' is open-source, available for every operating system, and more than sufficient for our needs. Installation is very user-friendly, and you can install it without changing any of the default settings (or tweak them if you know what they do).

**1.8.** Once you have installed PyCharm, execute it (e.g., launch it from the start menu) and on the PyCharm entry screen click the big '+' button to create a _new project_. Again, all the default settings are fine. If Python is not yet installed on your system, PyCharm offers to do this for you when you click "create". Please do so, and again, the default Python version should be fine, but make sure it's at least **Python 3.6**. (To clarify: Python is a programming language. PyCharm is a program to help you write Python programs.)

**1.9.** Inside your newly created project, have a look at the file `main.py` (which, on the default settings, PyCharm will have created for you) and try to run it.

**Something to keep in mind:** There are two main ways of executing Python code, i.e., of _applying the Python interpreter to your code_. The first is to use the _editor_ to write your Python code a file, and then 'run' the file as a whole. The second is to enter your code in an 'interactive Python interpreter', called **Python console** in PyCharm, executing each command directly.

**1.10.** In PyCharm, see if you can find the editor, the 'run' button, and the Python Console button. <p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwestera/py4ling/main/src/pycharm.png" width=35% height=35%></p>

**1.11.** As a student you can apply for the free PyCharm _educational license_ (https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). I would recommend getting this, mainly because it will let you host unlimited sessions of Code With Me (https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/), in case you want to program together with a friend at a distance.
